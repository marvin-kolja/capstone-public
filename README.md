## Introduction

This project was designed to execute repeated and controlled performance tests on mobile iOS applications using Xcode' [XCUITests](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xctest/user-interface-tests) for tests and [Instruments](https://developer.apple.com/tutorials/instruments/) app for metric collection. To achieve this, the project uses various Xcode Command Line Tools (e.g. `xcodebuild`) and [`pymobiledevice3`](https://github.com/doronz88/pymobiledevice3/tree/master) to interact with physical iOS devices. For a more detailed overview of these technologies please refer to the cores' README [Technologies](core/README.md#main-technologies) section.

On a high level, the project aims to provide the following features:

- âœ… Device selection and connection to physical iOS devices.
- âœ… Build an application from source code.
- âœ… Configure test plans that define the tests executed and the metrics collected.
- âœ… Execute test plan on a physical iOS device using the test plan configuration and build.
- âœ… Export and parse the collected metrics.
- ðŸš§ Package server with macOS app for easy use.

While these are a high level description of features, please take a look at each component to get a more detailed overview of the features and technologies used.

## Components

The project is divided into three main components:

| Component | Description                                                             | README                    |
|-----------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|
| Core      | A Python library that provides the main functionality of the project.   | [README](core/README.md)  |
| API       | A FastAPI server that provides a RESTful API to interact with the Core. | [README](api/README.md)   |
| macOS     | A SwiftUI macOS app that provides a graphical user interface.           | [README](macOS/README.md) |

### Repository Structure

```
/root
|-- core/                   # Core library
|-- api/                    # Backend
|-- macOS/                  # SwiftUI macOS app
|-- misc/                   # Miscellaneous files (example iOS xcode project and server installation script)
|-- README.md               # This file
```

## Usage

### Prerequisites

| Technology | Version | Description                                              |
|------------|---------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| Python     | 3.13+   | Api and Core were developed developed using Python 3.13. |
| Xcode      | 16+     | Xcode for xcode specific operations.                     |
| macOS      | -       | Running this on macOS is required.                       |

### Install and Run the API

1. Run the installation script

This will install python dependencies and sets up server environment (requires `python3.13` in PATH).

> [!CAUTION]
> As the project isn't publicly available on GitHub the following command requires a URL with a token.
> Please go to https://github.com/marvin-kolja/capstone/tree/main/misc/install_server.sh and get the RAW URL and replace the URL in the following command.

```bash
curl -sSL "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marvin-kolja/capstone/refs/heads/main/misc/install_server.sh" | bash
```

2. Start the server

```bash
sh ~/capstone/start_server.sh
```

3. Start the tunnel connect server

```bash
sh ~/capstone/start_tunnel_connect.sh
```

4. Make sure it's working

```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/health
# {"status":"unhealthy","db":"ok","tunnel_connect":"ok"}
```

### Install and Run the macOS App

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Currently, the macOS is not distributed to GitHub. You can either build it yourself or [contact](#contact) me for a pre-built signed and notarized version.

## Development

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone git@github.com:marvin-kolja/capstone.git
   cd capstone
   ```

2. Follow the setup instructions in each component's README.
    - [macOS README](macOS/README.md)
    - [API README](api/README.md)
    - [Core README](core/README.md)

3. Start the API and the macOS app as instructed in their respective READMEs.
